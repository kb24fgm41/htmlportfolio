  <p> Hey! Like I said earlier I was born in Spain, Im currently 29 years old, I live in souther Spain in a small city called Algeciras. 
    This city is located in a very beautiful area, weÂ´re surrounded by mountains a national park, its a city trapped between the meditarrenean and the 
    atlantic ocean. In front we have the views of Gibraltar which is the UK and to our right we have the views of the Atlas mountain, located in Morocco,Africa. 
    The beaches in our province are one of the best in the whole of Spain, my favourite is <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Ensenada_de_Bolonia_2009003.jpg"> Bolonia</a> located in Tarifa, 
    I reccommend anyone who reads this to visit. Its surrounded by beautiful pine trees and its got the second biggest sand dune 
    in the Europe.
