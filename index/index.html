      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p> My name is Francis G.M, I was born in Spain and I´m 29 years old. Welcome to my CV, here I will list my accomplishments, 
        strenghts and my future plans. A little about me first, I live in a small city called Algeciras, 
        after that I moved to Madrid to study dentistry, after doing dentistry and specializing in orthodontics I am now looking to find a 
        new career path in programming.</p>

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Sotogrande Internacional School</li>
        <li>Grado en Odontología. Unversidad CEU San Pablo, Madrid.</li>
        <li>Máster en ortodoncia. Universidad Católica de Murcia.</li>
        <li> London app brewery bootcamp on UDEMY.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Work experience</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Clínica unversitaria CEU San Pablo (2018-2019)</li>
        <li> GM ortodoncia digital e invisible (2019-Currently)</li>
      </ul> 

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p> I have gained many skills that are both valid for dentistry and programming. Orthodontics is a dental specialty 
        that always keeps you on your feet and most imporantly you have to think. You have to be constantly thinking about how to 
        solve cases. In this case youre trying to fix problems that patients bring to you, this is similar to programming in the sense
        that you will always be trying to code and figure out what your client needs and how youre going to present it in a satisfying 
        manner.
